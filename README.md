# About this fork

I was pleasantly surprised to find my memories of self-learning all the Windows basics, and many many many hours - now neatly packaged, and found by chance.

Very short recap. I pretty much only used [DependendyWalker](https://www.dependencywalker.com/) as my book, it opened the page to the functions it showed, that was the Table of Contents, then randomly going *Oh, why is there a function with that name, what does this DLL do? Let me check the offline MSDN Library...* And thats how it was, one function, one CPP file, lots of self-caused confusion (being almost all over everywhere, big and small difference in, coding standards, push the F5-key, and see what happens. Exploring a never-ending (truly) story. 

Memories. Thank you for this memory repo [zodiacon](https://github.com/zodiacon).

I am happy to see all kinds of code and some not (Javascript... the prehistoric kind), churning through the cycles of life as 1 CPU became 2, 4, 8...

But I miss the specialized focus I saw, here and there, small fast and efficient code. Feeling today Visual Studio 2010 is a Notepad of speed (pre Windows 11), the future have lots to learn.
